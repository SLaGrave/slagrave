### slagrave's repos

You can find my personal projects here! I sometimes participate in coding events, so you can find several year's repos for `Advent of Code` and `MIT Battlecode` here, along with other repos for things like my [esoteric programming language](https://github.com/SLaGrave/syscript) or [creative coding](https://github.com/SLaGrave/nannou-workspace).
