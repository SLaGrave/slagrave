Welcome to my README.
Eventually I will put something hidden here in the comments.
Until that point, congrats on realizing I would probably put something here!

# ðŸ¦‰ About me

I am a programmer, a language nerd, and occasional game designer.

I have a bachelor's in Computer Science, and make use of that in my day job writing software. I also spend my days explaining to coworkers why "best practices" are indeed best, and trying to pay off generational technical debt.


# ðŸŒ± Select personal projects

- As a self proclaimed programming language nerd, I has a small toy language I've released called [syscript](https://github.com/SLaGrave/syscript). I am also working on another language/tool to help better understand the SKI calculus.
- I am a big fan of the original computer generated art - none of this AI generated crap, it's all about procedural generation for me. You can see some of my attempts at that in my [nannou-workspace](https://github.com/SLaGrave/nannou-workspace) repo.
- I occasionally partake in coding events, so you can find several repos dedicated to `Advent of Code`, `MIT Battlecode`, and `NASA Space Apps`.
